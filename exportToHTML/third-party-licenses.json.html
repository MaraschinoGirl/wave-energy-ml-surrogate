COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</span><span class="s3">\n\n</span><span class="s2">Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">alleged intellectual property infringement.

The Indemnified</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</span><span class="s3">\n\n</span><span class="s2">For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial</span><span class="s3">\n</span><span class="s2">product offering, Product X.
